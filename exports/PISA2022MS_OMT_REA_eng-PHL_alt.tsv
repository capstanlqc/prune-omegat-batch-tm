"479"	"Amundsen wanted victory at the South Pole. On 14 January 1911, he disembarked in the Antarctic, in the Bay of Whales. He prepared to spend the winter with eight companions and 116 dogs at Framheim, a base built on the Ross Barrier. On 20 October 1911, Amundsen and four of his men set out from Framheim to conquer the South Pole with twelve dogs per sledge. On 17 November, at around 85° South, they reached the foot of a chain of mountains, the Transantarctic Chain, and would now have to find a way across. They then began a terrifying climb up a glacier, the Axel Heiberg, full of crevasses."	"Amundsen wanted victory at the South Pole.
